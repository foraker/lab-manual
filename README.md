# The Lab Manual

 The Lab Manual is a guide to development at Foraker Labs. It's where we document our strongly held opinions, our preferred tools, and how we go about particular tasks. It's also where we collect all of the resources that we believe to be essential to doing good work as a developer.

## Tools

These are the tools we use to create useful applications.

- [Object-Oriented Design](tools/object_oriented_design.md)
- [Ruby](tools/ruby.md)
- [Ruby on Rails](tools/ruby_on_rails.md)
- [JavaScript](tools/javascript.md)
- CSS
- [Git](tools/git.md)

## Process

When something works, we document it here.

- [Pull Requests](process/pull_requests.md)
