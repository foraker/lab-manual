# Object-Oriented Design

The world is made up of things and the interations between those things. Object-Oriented Design (OOD) helps us to model those things and interactions in software.

- [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby][poodr] is considered by many to be a modern classic on the subject, and should be a first read for those learning about OOD. It packs the most relevant OOD ideas into a concise form. :book:
- [Domain-Driven Design][ddd] is another classic. It is very long. Besides many of its ideas having made their way into frameworks such as Rails, it offers a valuable way to think about software and the development process. :book:
- [Refactoring: Ruby Edition][rre] is a rewritten verion of the venerable Martin Fowler book for Ruby. Refactoring is a large part of how we deliver changeable software, and the ideas here are central to that process. :book:
- [Design Patterns in Ruby][dpir] provides a Ruby-ified take on many of the proven "Gang of Four" design patterns, as well as detailing a few patterns that are unique to the Ruby community. While general OOD study is more important than seeking to implement any particular design pattern, this is a good introduction to and reference of common patterns.
