We work in Ruby because it is fun, productive, and ultimately allows us to deliver the most value to our clients.

## The Ruby Style Guide

We agree with almost everything in the community-maintained [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide). Note that we said "almost." In cases where the guide provides both "ok" and "good" options, we usually opt for the "good" option. If you use something in there that we outright don't agree with, we'll let you know in your pull request. We love to berate each other over style choices, so don't hesitate to stick your neck out!
