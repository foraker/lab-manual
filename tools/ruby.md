We work in Ruby because it's fun, productive, and ultimately allows us to deliver the most value to our clients.

## Books

- [Eloquent Ruby][er] is a great introduction to both the technical ins-and-outs of writing Ruby, as well as a guidebook for how to write Ruby _well_.
- [Confident Ruby][cr] focuses on a few key responsibilities of every method we write, and provides tactics for allowing these methods to tell compelling stories.

### The Ruby Style Guide

We agree with almost everything in the community-maintained [Ruby Style Guide][rsg]. Note that we said "almost." In cases where the guide provides both "ok" and "good" options, we usually opt for the "good" option. If you use something in there that we outright don't agree with, we'll let you know in your pull request. We love to berate each other over style choices, so don't hesitate to stick your neck out!
